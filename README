To get started running Infinitas, follow the steps below. Infinitas currently tested
and working (with some bugs) on various 5.x php installations with MySQL and MySQLi.
There is only  a web based installer option, although a shell option is planned.

(A) Quick Start Guide
================================================================================
0) If you dont have cake, download and set it up ( http://github.com/cakephp/cakephp )
	you can also get it with `git clone git://github.com/cakephp/cakephp`


(B) Manually
================================================================================
1) download the app from http://github.com/infinitas/infinitas
2) extract the files to the app dir, not ../app/infinits/<files> but ../app/<files>
3) If you would like the extra plugins (recomended)
	3a) you will need to download them all manually and put them in the plugins folder. maybe its time to start using git
4) see instructions below



(B) Via Git
================================================================================1) cd into your servers webroot directory
1) git clone git://github.com/infinitas/infinitas.git infinitas/
2) cd infinitas/

3) If you would like the extra plugins (recomended)
	3a) git submodule init
	3b) git submodule update
4) see instructions below


(C) Installation
================================================================================
5) make APP/config/ and APP/tmp/ writeable for the installation
6) create a db (remember the name and login details for just now)
7) visit the corresponding url to where you cloned it to (http://localhost/infinitas/ maybe)
8) Follow the instructions
	8a) Some enviroments throw a `504 Gateway timeout` error during install, if this happens hit refresh within a few seconds and it should install fine
	8b) although there is a `sample data` option, it is not currently working. its coming
9) If all has gone well you should be on a screen that asks you to enter the main administration details, fill this out and hit enter
10) pat yourself on the back, infinitas is now running :)
